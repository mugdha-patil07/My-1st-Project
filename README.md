# My Portfolio Website

This is my first personal portfolio website created using basic HTML and CSS. It includes a header, navigation bar, about section, projects section, and contact information. The site is styled with simple, clean CSS and designed to be a starting point for my web development journey.

## Features
- Responsive layout using basic HTML structure
- Styled with clean and minimal CSS
- Sections: Home, About, Projects, and Contact

## How to View
You can open `index.html` in any web browser or view it live using GitHub Pages.

## Future Plans
- Add project cards with images
- Make it mobile-friendly
- Include contact form functionality
